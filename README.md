# emotion-recognition-app
Android App that helps children on the spectrum recognize emotions using the phones camera, face tracking, and machine learning

MOTIVATION:<br>
I have been having two recurring conversations lately with friends:
The first is how we think that not seeing enough strangers faces (due to masks) during early formative years might lead to an increased incedence of aspergers like symptoms. 
The second, similar conversation has been how the same is true of children who's parents just hand them an iPad to play on instead of spending quality social time with the poor kid. 
Regardless of if these ideas are true, existing children on the spectrum seem to be able to navigate relationships better after being taught how to read and respond to emotions. It is in the spirit of bringing this practice from an isolated, classroom/online course like setting into more of a real world, real time application that I am making this app.
